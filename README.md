# CourseCarePager

A Web extension that makes a sound whenever a student joins the queue on Course Care

# What is Course Care

Course.Care is a website that enables UNC Teaching Assistants (TA) to host office hours. Students can join the office hours either on zoom or in-person, and their attendance will be logged. At the end of every ticket, students and TAs can give each other a rating and add any notes about the meeting. This data will also be logged onto the system's database.

# Problem

Course Care no longer makes a sound or alerts TAs when a student creates a ticket. This can lead to longer wait times as the TAs could be on a different tab doing something else. The best workaround that TAs have done to solve this problem is to have a second monitor, where the Course Care website is open so that they can see whenever there is a new student in the queue. This gets the job done but is not always ideal.

# Solution

Course Care Pager is a chrome web extension that notifies the TA with a sound whenenver a student is added to the queue. This is the baseline functionality. There may be more stretch goals for this project in the future.
